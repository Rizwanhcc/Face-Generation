# Face-Generation
In this project We Build a pair of multi-layer neural networks and make them compete against each other in order to generate new, realistic faces. We trained them on a set of celebrity faces, and see what new faces the computer generates..!

### Sample input images

## Objectives of the Project

In this project,  The goal was to get a generator network to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible by utilizing a DCGAN on a dataset of faces.

## Output of the GAN
The model has generated the following real looking human images that highly ressemble with the human images.
